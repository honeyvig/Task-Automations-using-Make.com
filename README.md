# Task-Automations-using-Make.com
This is a long term position and will require someone who is a team player. My company has over a dosen full time virtual assistants some of them have worked with us for 10 years.

We are seeking an AI specialist to develop and implement automated agents for our business using Make.com.

The ideal candidate will have experience in creating workflows and automating repetitive tasks to enhance efficiency.

You will work closely with our team to identify processes that can be automated and design solutions that streamline our operations.

Things you will automate are:
-Ai agent that will take inbound calls after hours to schedule clients on my calendar.
-You will Get Trending articles and spin that information for me to create content for my audience.
- You will help increase our SEO presence through Ai automation
-Just to name a few

Knowledge of AI tools and a strong understanding of Make.com functionality are essential for this role.
=================
Below is Python code to demonstrate AI automation for tasks using a combination of OpenAI's API and external integrations. While Make.com (formerly Integromat) focuses on no-code/low-code solutions, the code highlights workflows that align with your goals and can complement Make.com integrations.
1. Prerequisites

    Install Required Libraries:

    pip install openai flask flask-cors twilio beautifulsoup4 requests

    Set Up Accounts:
        OpenAI: For AI models.
        Twilio: For handling inbound calls and scheduling.
        SEO Tools: Integrate with APIs for keyword analysis.

2. Python Implementation

import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS
import openai
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from twilio.rest import Client

# Environment variables
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"
os.environ["TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"] = "your-twilio-account-sid"
os.environ["TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"] = "your-twilio-auth-token"
os.environ["CALENDAR_API"] = "your-calendar-api-key"

# Flask app setup
app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# OpenAI setup
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Twilio setup
twilio_client = Client(os.getenv("TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"), os.getenv("TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"))

# Helper: AI Content Creation
def generate_content(topic):
    """Generate content based on trending topics."""
    prompt = f"Write a brief, engaging article on the topic: {topic}. Spin it into a unique style for social media."
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=300
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Helper: Extract trending articles
def get_trending_articles(url):
    """Scrape trending articles from a news site."""
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    articles = soup.find_all("h2", class_="headline")  # Adjust based on site structure
    return [article.text for article in articles[:5]]

# Helper: Schedule appointment
def schedule_appointment(client_name, client_time):
    """Add an event to the calendar."""
    event_data = {
        "summary": f"Appointment with {client_name}",
        "start": {"dateTime": client_time, "timeZone": "UTC"},
        "end": {"dateTime": client_time, "timeZone": "UTC"},
    }
    response = requests.post(
        f"https://your-calendar-api.com/events",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('CALENDAR_API')}"},
        json=event_data
    )
    return response.json()

# Endpoint: Automate inbound calls (example simulation)
@app.route("/inbound-call", methods=["POST"])
def inbound_call():
    """Handle after-hours calls."""
    data = request.json
    client_name = data.get("client_name")
    preferred_time = data.get("preferred_time")

    # Schedule appointment
    response = schedule_appointment(client_name, preferred_time)
    if response.get("status") == "success":
        return jsonify({"message": "Appointment scheduled successfully."})
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Failed to schedule appointment."}), 500

# Endpoint: Generate SEO content
@app.route("/generate-content", methods=["POST"])
def generate_seo_content():
    """Create SEO-optimized content."""
    data = request.json
    topic = data.get("topic")

    # Generate content
    content = generate_content(topic)
    return jsonify({"content": content})

# Endpoint: Fetch trending topics
@app.route("/trending-topics", methods=["GET"])
def trending_topics():
    """Get trending articles and generate content."""
    articles = get_trending_articles("https://example-news-site.com/trending")
    return jsonify({"trending_articles": articles})

# Endpoint: SEO optimization (stub for further integration)
@app.route("/seo-optimize", methods=["POST"])
def seo_optimize():
    """Increase SEO presence (stub)."""
    data = request.json
    keyword = data.get("keyword")

    # Example API for SEO analysis (replace with actual tool)
    response = requests.get(f"https://seo-tool-api.com/analyze?keyword={keyword}")
    return jsonify({"seo_analysis": response.json()})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

3. Explanation of Automations

    Inbound Call Scheduling:
        Simulated using Twilio API to manage after-hours client calls.
        Data is sent to the /inbound-call endpoint, which interacts with a calendar API to schedule appointments.

    Content Generation:
        The /generate-content endpoint uses OpenAI to spin trending topics into SEO-optimized content.

    Trending Articles:
        The /trending-topics endpoint scrapes headlines from a news site and returns top articles.

    SEO Optimization:
        Stubbed integration to enhance SEO presence by analyzing keywords using third-party tools.

4. Deployment

    Backend:
        Deploy the Flask app using platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

    Frontend:
        Integrate endpoints into a UI using frameworks like React.js or Vue.js.

    Make.com:
        Use the app's REST API for workflows in Make.com to automate task triggers.

5. Future Enhancements

    Advanced Calendar Integration:
        Sync with Google or Outlook Calendars using their APIs for real-time updates.

    Enhanced SEO Analytics:
        Integrate with tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs for detailed keyword recommendations.

    Multi-Channel Communication:
        Extend Twilio integration for SMS/email confirmations for scheduled appointments.

    AI Feedback Loop:
        Use user interactions to improve AI prompt design and workflow efficiency.

This setup is a foundation for automation workflows that can integrate seamlessly with Make.com or other platforms. Let me know if you want further customizations or advanced features!
